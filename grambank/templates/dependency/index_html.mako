The strength of the functional dependency between two features F1 and F2 is defined as H(F2)/MI(F1, F2), over all languages for which both features are defined. H(X) is the Shannon entropy of the value distribution of the feature X across languages. MI(X, Y) = H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y) is the mutual information between X and Y. To hide circular and epiphenomenal dependencies the maximum spanning tree of the dependency graph is computed using the Chu-Liu algorithm. A dependency is called primary if it remains in the Chu-Liu and epiphenomenal otherwise. For more information, see:
